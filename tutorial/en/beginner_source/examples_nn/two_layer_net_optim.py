PyTorch: optim
--------------

A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer, trained to predict y from x
by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation uses the nn package from PyTorch to build the network.

Rather than manually updating the weights of the model as we have been doing,
we use the optim package to define an Optimizer that will update the weights
for us. The optim package defines many optimization algorithms that are commonly
used for deep learning, including SGD+momentum, RMSProp, Adam, etc.
