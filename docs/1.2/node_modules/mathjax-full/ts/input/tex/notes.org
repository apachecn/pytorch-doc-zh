* Testing
  Currently I've implemented a trivial test runner using tape.
  This should change in the future:

** Unit tests 
   Probably with Mocha

** Platform testing 
   Karma

* Refactoring of TeX Input

** Maps

*** General structure discussion:
   
    It is awkward to have generic interface definition! Therefore we needed to
    replace SymbolMap with a non-generic base interface. Base interface should
    only have the contains method that will always return a boolean. Abstract
    base class then is generic with lookup method (or apply for parsing).


*** Abstract Base class symbol map

*** TODO Do we have to have a trivial subclass that handles digits, numbers and characters?

**** Regexp class

*** concrete classes:

**** character map: char + attributes

***** Objects: special, remap, mathchar0mi, mathchar0mo, mathchar7, delimiter

**** macro map: function + arguments

**** environment map: function + arguments

*** Each class gets a specific method to execute it


** Map handler with

*** lookup function

*** change of map (for different configurations)

** Handling environments: 
**** If we only through an unknown environment for begin and have unknown end handled differently?

* Previous notes
** Checkout problems with tests.
** The texparser needs to extend abstract input jax
** Need to fill MathItem.
** Build it on MmlNodes



*** From map handler parse function. This is probably obsolete!
  // I think here we should return the JSON value that can be handled by the
  // parser. Meaning we should give the symbol_map a function that actually
  // performs the parsing. E.g., a singular method for RegExp and Character. An
  // execution method for custom functions on Macro.
  // 
  // This can then be actually put into the interface. We can then avoid casting!
  //
  // Also: How are we to know "outside" what the actual value is?

* Notes for future refactoring:

** Why does TextNode not inherit AbstractMmlNode. This hiearchy with empty nodes seems to be odd.

** msubsup.ts -> no TEXCLASS

** Tests that currently do not work:
   
*** Choose, Over With Delims, Above With Delims (Need the mathchoice extension!)

*** Label: Uses AMS Math stuff.
    
*** Named Function: AutoOP, FnOP?

*** Limit: mml.SPACE_ATTR ? 

*** Modulo: uses mathchoice

*** Checkout Dots

*** Delimiters-left-right seems to have one mrow too many in the expected value

*** Dots The mo elements seem to be getting the wrong texclass.

** AMS methods already done:
   EndEntry, EndTable, fixInitialMO

**** For Davide: How does With with nested dictionary work.

* Review 1 notes

** TEXCLASSNAMES: 
   Part of the old attribute handling mechanism. The "real" attributes were not
   being kept separate from the internal attributes, and so you could not tell
   which were to be copied into MathML output. This specified a list of ones
   that should not be (even though they had default values in some objects).

*** They should eventually be removed and used from the operator lookup table.

** MML.chars:
   The children of token nodes are text nodes. That is what this implements (the
   equivalent of the HTML #text node). In version v, this is the TextNode node
   (in core/MmlTree/MmlNode.ts as I recall). The MML.entity type is gone in v3
   and folded into the TextNode. I originally thought the entity class would
   keep the original entity name (e.g., pi from &pi;, but the turned out to be a
   bad idea, and not really possible since the entities were already translated
   to characters by the browser before MathJax even sees them). So the class
   ended up being superfluous.

*** This is effectively the new textnode class.
