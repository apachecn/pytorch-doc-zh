# MathJax (Source Repository)

## Beautiful math in all browsers

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML,
andAsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was
designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web
technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform
supporting the major browsers and operating systems.  It requires no
setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to
install), so the page author can write web documents that include
mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it
naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in
a web page, and MathJax does the rest.

Some of the main features of MathJax include:

- High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages

- Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special
  setup for the reader

- Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers

- Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other
  advanced functionality

- Powerful API for integration with other web applications

See <http://www.mathjax.org/> for additional details about MathJax,
and <https://docs.mathjax.org> for the MathJax documentation.

## What's in this Repository

This repository contains the source files for MathJax, which are
written in Typescript.  These are compiled into javascript files and
then combined into component files for use on the web.  The component
files are available from several [CDN services that host
MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/start.html#using-mathjax-from-a-content-delivery-network-cdn),
and also from the [MathJax Component
Repository](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax).  Node applications
can use either the component files, or call the MathJax javascript
files directly.

## Installation and Use

### Using MathJax in web browsers

If you are loading MathJax from a CDN into a web page, there is no
need to install anything.  Simply use a `script` tag that loads
MathJax from the CDN.  E.g.,

    <script id="MathJax-script" async
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
    </script>
    
See the [MathJax
documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html#browser-components),
the [MathJax Web Demos](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web),
and the [MathJax Component
Repository](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web) for more information.




### Using MathJax Components in node applications

To use MathJax components in a node application, install the `mathjax`
package:

    npm install mathjax

and require `mathjax` within your application:

    require('mathjax').init({ ... }).then((MathJax) => { ... });
    
where the first `{ ... }` is a MathJax configuration, and the second
`{ ... }` is the code to run after MathJax has been loaded.  E.g.

    require('mathjax').init({
      loader: {
        require: require,
        paths: {mathjax: 'mathjax/es5'},
        load: ['input/tex', 'output/svg']
      }
    }).then((MathJax) => {
      const svg = MathJax.tex2svg('\\frac{1}{x^2-1}', {display: true});
      console.log(MathJax.startup.adaptor.outerHTML(svg));
    }).catch((err) => console.log(err.message));

    
See the
[documentation](https//docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html#server-nodejs)
and the [MathJax Node
Repository](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node)for more details.

### Using MathJax modules directly in node applications

You can use the MathJax javascript files (as opposed to MathJax
components) directly in node applications.  This gives you the
greatest flexibility, but requires more coding.  To use this approach,
install the `mathjax-full` package:

    npm install mathjax-full

This will provide the following directories:

    node_modules/
      mathjax-full/
        ts/                  the MathJax source Typescript files
        js/                  the compiled javascript files
        components/          the component build tools and control files
        es5/                 the packages component files

You can use the components and javascript files directly in your node
applications (see the [MathJax node
demos](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-node) for examples).

If you want to work from the GitHub repository directly, then do the following:

    git clone https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src.git mathjax-src
    cd mathjax-src
    npm run compile
    npm run make-components

in order to compile the javascript files from the Typescript source,
and build the component files from the javascript files.

## Code Contributions

If you are interested in contributing code to MathJax, please see the
[documentation for contributors](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how
to do this, and for the policies for making pull requests.  In
particular, please be careful that you are working from the proper
branch in the git repository, or you may be asked to rebase your
changes when you make a pull request.

## MathJax Community

The main MathJax website is <http://www.mathjax.org>, and it includes
announcements and other important information.  A [MathJax user
forum](http://groups.google.com/group/mathjax-users) for asking
questions and getting assistance is hosted at Google, and the [MathJax
bug tracker](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues) is hosted
at GitHub.

Before reporting a bug, please check that it has not already been
reported.  Also, please use the bug tracker (rather than the help
forum) for reporting bugs, and use the user's forum (rather than the
bug tracker) for questions about how to use MathJax.
