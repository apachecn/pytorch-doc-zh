def compile(arg=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Decorator which marks a function or module class as eligible for
    just-in-time compilation.  The next time the function/module is executed, it
    is traced, and the trace is compiled into an optimized representation which
    is run in lieu of the original Python code upon subsequent invocations of
    the function/module.

    .. note::

        A JIT compiled function/module may be compiled multiple times, as
        different inputs can result in different traces.  Currently, the
        JIT compiler conservatively assumes the trace may change if the
        `size` or `requires_grad` of `Variable` inputs change, or if
        any of the non-Variable inputs change.  For example, if you JIT
        compile an RNN which takes the number of hidden units as a parameter,
        we will compile a trace for every RNN length you use at runtime.

        When a module class is JIT compiled, each instantiation of the module
        gets a separate trace cache.

    .. warning::

        Just-in-time compilation currently only works for functions/modules
        which are not data dependent (e.g., have conditionals on data in
        tensors) and do not have any untracked external dependencies (e.g.,
        perform input/output or access global variables). If you trace such
        models, you will silently get incorrect results on subsequent
        invocations of the model.

    Keyword arguments:
        nderivs (int, optional): the number of derivatives which this function/module
            will be used with.  You MUST accurately specify this number: set it too
            low and you will see an error when you attempt to run `backward`;
            set it too high, and the function/module will never be compiled
            (as we always wait to see all derivatives before compiling.)
            Default: 1 (i.e., we will compile forwards and backwards, but not
            double-backwards).
        optimize (bool, optional): whether or not to apply optimizations.  Default: ``True``.

    Debug arguments:
        time (bool, optional): if ``True``, whenever we execute the model in question, we
            will also print out some timing information for how long the model
            took to execute.  At the moment, there are three types of timings we
            emit:

                - unoptimized: the time it took to execute the vanilla Python
                  model.  This only occurs when tracing is disabled, e.g., via
                  `enabled=False`

                - tracing: the time it took to execute the vanilla Python model
                  with tracing enabled.

                - optimized: the time it took to execute the optimized model.

            At the moment, all of these timings are for the forward pass only.
            Default: ``False``.
        enabled (bool, optional): if ``False``, compilation is disabled and you
            will get back your original model.  This is a convenient way to
            disable tracing without having to delete the annotation. Default: ``True``.

    Example: Compile as class decorator.

        >>> @jit.compile
        >>> class MyModel(nn.Module):
        >>>     ...
        >>> model = MyModel()
        >>> out1 = model(x)        # interpreted run
        >>> out1.sum().backward()  # won't compile without this line
        >>> out2 = model(x)        # compiled run
        >>> out2.sum().backward()  # also compiled

    Example: Compile forward pass only as class decorator.

        >>> @jit.compile(nderivs=0)
        >>> class MyModel(nn.Module):
        >>>     ...
        >>> model = MyModel()
        >>> out1 = model(x)        # interpreted run
        >>> out2 = model(x)        # compiled run

    Example: Compile as function decorator.  The same modes of use for the class
    decorator are also supported for functions; however, the decorated
    function must declare *all* Variable inputs in its arguments.

        >>> @jit.compile
        >>> def f(x);
        >>>     return x * 2

# - It is given an underlying function, which knows how to actually

# - When we encounter an input configuration for which we don't
#   have an optimized trace, we run the underlying function, tracing its
#   result.  The trace is not done yet, so we save it into our set of pending
#   traces for that configuration.
# - When we encounter an input configuration whose trace is "ready"
#   (that is, we've seen all of the passes, so the trace contains
#   forwards/backwards/etc), we compile it, and then register this
#   as the compiled trace.

    Verify that a JIT compiled model has the same behavior as its uncompiled
    version along with its backwards pass.  If your model returns multiple
    outputs, you must also specify a `loss_fn` to produce a loss for which
    the backwards will be computed.

    This function has side-effects (e.g., it executes your model / saves and loads
    parameters), so don't expect the model to come out exactly the same as what
    you passed in.

    Arguments:
        model (compiled torch.nn.Module or function): the module/function to be
            verified.  The module/function definition MUST have been decorated with
            `@torch.jit.compile`.
        args (tuple or Variable): the positional arguments to pass to the
            compiled function/module to be verified.  A non-tuple is assumed to
            be a single positional argument to be passed to the model.
        loss_fn (function, optional): the loss function to be applied to
            the output of the model, before backwards is invoked.  By default,
            we assume that a model returns a single result, and we :func:`torch.sum`
            before calling backwards; if this is inappropriate, you can pass your
            own loss function.  Note that if a model returns a tuple of results,
            these are passed as separate positional arguments to `loss_fn`.
        devices (iterable of device IDs, optional): the GPU devices which the
            compiled module will be run on.  This determines the RNG state we
            must save when running both compiled and uncompiled versions of the model.
